  "description": "Over $600k was rescued from deprecated contracts of decentralised exchange Hashflow. A whitehat hacker created a contract to rescue the funds and return them to the rightful owners. Users of Hashflow are advised to revoke all approvals to these deprecated contracts before claiming their rescued funds. Some user funds were still stolen by black-hat hackers after the initial rescue though.",
