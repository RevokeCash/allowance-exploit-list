  "name": "Biswap v3 Migrator Hack",
  "description": "Over $850k was stolen from liquidity providers of Biswap, a decentralized exchange on BNB Chain. Biswap recently launched their v3, and the team created a migrator contract to help users migrate their liquidity from v2 to v3. The migrator contract lacked proper access control, and an attacker was able to call the migrator contract to steal funds from liquidity providers. The Biswap team has started reimbursing affected users.",
