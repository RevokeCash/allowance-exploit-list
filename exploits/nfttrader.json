  "name": "NFT Trader Hack",
  "description": "Close to $3M worth of NFTs was stolen from users of the peer to peer platform NFTTrader, mostly made up of Bored Apes and Mutant Apes. The main exploiter discovered a reentrancy bug in multiple old contracts of NFT Trader, allowing them to drain users' approved assets. Multiple other exploiters followed suit. Representatives from Yuga Labs and Boring Security DAO have since successfully negotiated with the main exploiter to return the assets in return for a 10% bounty. Several hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of NFTs is still in the hands of other exploiters.",
