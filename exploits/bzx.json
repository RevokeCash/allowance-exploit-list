  "description": "Over $55M has been stolen from bZx's smart contracts and its users due to a compromised private key. The hackers used these compromised keys to deploy an upgrade to the existing contracts, allowing them to drain users that have open allowances. This is the final nail in the coffin for bZx, which has been exploited multiple times in the past.",
