# Crypto Allowance Exploit List

`allowance-exploit-list` contains a list of known crypto exploits that abuse allowances in order to steal funds from users.

## Check if you are affected by these exploits

Revoke.cash offers a tool to check if you are affected by any of these exploits. You can find it [here](https://revoke.cash/exploits).

## Contributing

To submit a new exploit to the database, you can create a new GitHub issue by using the "Report Exploit" template or click on the button below. Please make sure to be as complete as possible when filling out the template. We will then verify the information and add it to the list.
